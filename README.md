- Use modular architecture for maintainability
- Include logging for debugging

### Game Architecture
Each game follows a consistent structure:

```javascript
class GameName {
    constructor() {
        // Initialize game state
        this.gameState = 'playing';
        this.score = 0;
        this.level = 1;
        
        // Setup canvas and context
        this.canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
        this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d');
        
        // Initialize game objects
        this.player = {};
        this.gameObjects = [];
        
        // Start game loop
        this.init();
    }
    
    init() {
        this.setupEventListeners();
        this.createLevel();
        this.gameLoop();
    }
    
    gameLoop() {
        if (this.gameState === 'playing') {
            this.update();
        }
        this.render();
        requestAnimationFrame(() => this.gameLoop());
    }
    
    update() {
        // Update game logic
    }
    
    render() {
        // Render game elements
    }
}
```

### Asset Guidelines
- **Images**: Use WebP format when possible, provide PNG fallbacks
